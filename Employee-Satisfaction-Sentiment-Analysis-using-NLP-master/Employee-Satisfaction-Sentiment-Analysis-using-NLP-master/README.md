Employee Satisfaction plays a crucial role in the success of any organization. Companies with happy employees are more likely to have high customer satisfaction scores than their counterparts. One way to understand what employees feel about their company is from their reviews. But reading thousands of reviews can be a nightmare to any individual. 

To solve this problem this project aimes to perform a sentiment analysis of top companies using text reviews from sites like Glassdoor and build a dashboard using Tableau showing average sentiment of all companies and identify the best / worst features of the company , which the particular company can act upon.
